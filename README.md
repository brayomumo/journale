# journale
Journale is a Django-based web application where users can submit their daily thoughts (journals) and they can be shared with another user who journaled the same day.

It uses the Relation database(SQLLite) for data storage and Celery for running periodic tasks responsible for emailing journals. The front end is built on the Django templating engine and TailwindCSS for easier data operations.
